# Dead Code Elimination

## Idea

Dead codes are the instructions or codes in the program which are executed but their result is never used in the program.
Dead code elimination removes such useless codes which reduces the space taken by the program in the memory and the execution time.The elimination of Dead code does not affects the result of the program.

## Background

Dead Code Elimination is an optimization that removes code which does not affect the program results. You might wonder why someone would write this type of source code, but it can easily creep into large, long-lived programs even at the source code level. Removing such code has several benefits: it shrinks program size and it allows the running program to avoid executing irrelevant operations, which reduces its running time. It can also enable further optimizations by simplifying program structure.

For example, consider the following code:

```{r eval=FALSE}
foo <- function() {
  a <- 24
  if (a > 25) {
    return(25)
    a <- 25 # dead code
  }
  return(a)
  b <- 24 # dead code
  return(b) # dead code
}
```

In functions, after calling `return`, the following code would not be executed, so it is dead code and can be eliminated. In this example, resulting in:

```{r eval=FALSE}
foo <- function() {
  a <- 24
  if (a > 25) {
    return(25)
  }
  return(a)
}
```

Also, after constant [propagating](opt-constant-propagation.html) and [folding](opt-constant-folding.html) we would get:

```{r eval=FALSE}
foo <- function() {
  a <- 24
  if (FALSE) { # dead code
    return(25) # dead code
  } # dead code
  return(a)
}
```

So it could be reduced to:

```{r eval=FALSE}
foo <- function() {
  a <- 24
  return(a)
}
```

This dead code optimizer also removes code after `next` or `break` calls.

## Example

Consider the following example:

```{r}
code <- paste(
  "i <- 0",
  "n <- 1000",
  "while (i < n) {",
  "  if (TRUE) {",
  "    i <- i + 1",
  "  } else {",
  "    i <- i - 1",
  "  }",
  "}",
  sep = "\n"
)
cat(code)
```

Then, the automatically optimized code would be:

```{r}
opt_code <- opt_dead_code(list(code))
cat(opt_code$codes[[1]])
```

And if we measure the execution time of each one, and the speed-up:

```{r message=FALSE}
bmark_res <- microbenchmark({
  eval(parse(text = code))
}, {
  eval(parse(text = opt_code))
})
autoplot(bmark_res)
speed_up(bmark_res)
```

## Implementation

The `opt_dead_code` optimizer performs two main tasks:

### Remove code after interruption commands

All the code, that is equally-nested, found after a `break`, `next`, or `return` call is removed. Something important to note is that it assumes that **the `return` function has not been overwritten**.

### Remove constant conditionals

This task has sub-items:

  * Remove `FALSE` whiles: `while (FALSE) { expr }` expressions are removed from the code.
  
  * Remove `FALSE` ifs: `if (FALSE) { expr }` expressions are removed. And `if (FALSE) { expr1 } else { expr2 }` is replaced by `expr2`.
  
  * Replace `TRUE` ifs: `if (TRUE) { expr }` is replaced by `expr`. And `if (TRUE) { expr1 } else { expr2 }` is replaced by `expr1`.
