# Loop-invariant Code Motion

## Idea

A loop is an algorithm that continuously executes a piece of code until a condition is met, or not met. 

However, a part of the piece of code in a loop may not be directly affected by the condition of the loop. For example, given a variable ```i``` of arbitrary value, a loop can define a condition to run until ```i``` is greater than a constant ```n``` with ```i``` being incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop. Any piece of code that only uses operands defined or assigned outside the loop can be removed and still yield the same value. In this case, an operation ```x = y + z``` is in no way affected by the incrementation of variable ```i```. 

The following documentation will provide a background behind this optimization technique and examples of how this can be implemented on production-grade code.

## Background

Loop-invariant code consists of statements or expressions which can be moved outside the body of a loop without affecting the semantics of the program. Loop-invariant code motion is a compiler optimization which performs this movement automatically. 

For example, consider the following code:

```{r eval=FALSE}
i <- 0
n <- 1000
y <- rnorm(1)
z <- rnorm(1)
a <- c()
while (i < n) {
  x <- y + z
  a[i] <- 6 * i + x * x
  i <- i + 1
}
```

Here, `x` is assigned a value `y + z` that is constant in each loop execution. In this example, the assignment would be executed `n` times. The same result, but much faster, would be obtained by doing the assign outside the loop.

## Example

Consider the previous example to be automatically optimized.

```{r}
code <- paste(
  "i <- 0",
  "n <- 1000",
  "y <- rnorm(1)",
  "z <- rnorm(1)",
  "a <- c()",
  "while (i < n) {",
  "  x <- y + z",
  "  a[i] <- 6 * i + x * x",
  "  i <- i + 1",
  "}",
  sep = "\n"
)
cat(code)
```

Then, the automatically optimized code would be:

```{r}
opt_code <- opt_loop_invariant(list(code))
cat(opt_code$codes[[1]])
```

And if we measure the execution time of each one, and the speed-up:

```{r message=FALSE}
bmark_res <- microbenchmark({
  eval(parse(text = code))
}, {
  eval(parse(text = opt_code))
})
autoplot(bmark_res)
speed_up(bmark_res)
```

## Implementation

The `opt_loop_invariant` optimizer does:

* Finds `for` and `while` loops in the code.

* Discards loops that have function calls inside, as function calls can edit the environment.

* Gets which variables are variant inside the loop.

* Detects which expressions do not use any variant variable.

* Gets these invariant variables, and moves them outside the loop, but inside an `if` statement (with the same conditional as the loop).

## To-Do

* `if/else` code motion?
  
  Actually, the `opt_loop_invariant` does not consider `if/else` expressions to move. In this sense, the code:
  
  ```{r eval=FALSE}
  while (i < n) {
    if (n > 3) {
      something_without_i
    }
  }
  ```
  
  Will not be optimized to its equivalent code:
  
  ```{r eval=FALSE}
  if (i < n) {
    if (n > 3) {
      something_without_i
    }
  }
  while (i < n) {
  }
  ```

* Invariant subexpressions motion?
  
  Actually, the `opt_loop_invariant` considers only full expressions, it is not working on subexpressions, for instance, the code:
  
  ```{r eval=FALSE}
  while (i < n) {
    i <- (x * y) + 1
  }
  ```
  
  as `x` and `y` are invariant, could be optimized to:
  
  ```{r eval=FALSE}
  is_1 <- (x * y)
  while (i < n) {
    i <- is_1 + 1
  }
  ```

* Include `repeat` optimization?
  
  Since determining the conditional that causes a `repeat` loop to stop is not that simple, it is not easy to remove invariant variables and place them in an `if`.
  
  For example, the code:
  
  ```{r eval=FALSE}
  y <- 1
  repeat{
    if (y > 4) {
      break
    }
    x <- 8 * 8
    y <- y + 1
  }
  ```
  
  Must be optimized to:
  
  ```{r eval=FALSE}
  y <- 1
  if (y <= 4) {
    x <- 8 * 8
  }
  repeat{
    if (y > 4) {
      break
    }
    y <- y + 1
  }
  ```
